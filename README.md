Gtk::EntryCompletion examples - Because I couldn't find working examples

That's it, I was making a little project and I couldn't find working examples on
this component in C++ for Gtk+3.0. A lot of them were in Python, a lot of them were 
for older versions and a lot of them didn't compile.

You're free to use this example.

## What you can find here
  - Example 1 : Easy way to have a working completion in your Gtk::Entry
  - Example 2 : Easy way to manage string-only completions for your Gtk::Entry objects

## Example 1 

   Shows the simplest completion example. Just create a simple GUI: a box, a label, a button
   and the entry component.
   Entry completion is filled up with european countries. I wanted to show a customizable way
   to do it


To compile this example, just do:

```
g++ -o main main.cpp mainwindow.cpp `pkg-config --libs --cflags gtkmm-3.0`
```

Of course you can put CompletionRecord class in any other place, but I used this way to be
more familiar with other Gtkmm examples.


You can use this code if you already have created a model (e.g. for a Gtk::TreeView) and you want
the user to autocomplete the Entry Fields with this data.

## Example 2

   Just a simple EntryCompletion class (now EasyCompletion) which uses its own Model to store Glib::ustring
   objects. Only if you want to make a simple completion. It allows being populated with a STL vector which
   makes it easy sometimes.

   But EasyCompletion class may be extended to support another string input methods.

It's useful if you want to create several Entry components with completion and don't want to be creating
and maintaining models.

EasyCompletion class allows:
   - addString (Glib::ustring str, bool norepeat = true) : adds a string to the record, optionally checks it
     to not insert anything twice.
   - clearStrings () : clear all strings in the record
   - deleteString (Glib::ustring str) : search for str and deletes it (only once).
   - insertVector (std::vector<Glib::ustring> strVector, bool norepeat = true) : adds strings from a STL vector.

To compile this example, just do:

```
g++ -o main main.cpp mainwindow.cpp easycompletion.cpp `pkg-config --libs --cflags gtkmm-3.0`
```
